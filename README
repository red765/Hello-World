A kappa that lives on Youkai Mountain. For a long time, kappa haven't let themselves be seen by humans, but since they usually hide to watch humans, they like to think that they are on good terms with humans.
She may suddenly change her attitude or speech, and she possesses a rather odd personality, but she's unexpectedly shy. She runs away the moment she sees a human.
Since she's an engineering nut, whenever she sees something man-made, she takes it apart and puts it back together. Because of this, her clothes are stuffed with tools.
She wanted to chase away Reimu and the others who had entered the mountain, but this is only because she believed that there was some sort of emergency occurring on the mountain, and she thought the humans would be in danger.
In the end, since Reimu and company didn't take her advice, Nitori secretly decided to let them into the mountain. She thought it would be interesting to watch them interact with the mysterious new god.
As a result of the ensuing battle, the kappa came to accept the new god of the mountain.
